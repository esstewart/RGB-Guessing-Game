# RGB Guessing Game
RGB Color guessing game based on Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp "Color Game Project".

GPL 3.0 License

Wrote most of the game on my own, prior to watching the videos and watched the videos on 1.75x speed whenever I got stuck. Also made my own changes to it (added medium mode, changed the size of the squares depending on difficulty, etc).

How to play
------------------
1. Game will start on its own or you can select a difficulty.
2. Look at the randomly selected RGB color at the top.
3. Look at the colored squares and click the one you think is the color that matches the RGB value.
4. Keep clicking until you guess correctly!
5. Click "Play Again?" to play again.

Difficulties are
* Easy (three squares)
* Medium (six squares)
* Hard (nine squares)
